# MITRE ATT&CK® Go Application

MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

This Go application leverages the MITRE ATT&CK® framework to provide advanced threat detection, mapping, and analysis capabilities for cybersecurity professionals and organizations.

## Overview
This project provides a Go-based platform for ingesting, processing, and analyzing security events in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK® framework. It enables organizations to:
- Map observed events to ATT&CK tactics and techniques
- Detect and alert on adversary behaviors
- Generate reports and visualizations based on ATT&CK mappings
- Integrate with SIEMs, SOARs, and other security tools

## Features
- **ATT&CK Mapping:** Automatically map security events to ATT&CK tactics and techniques.
- **Event Ingestion:** Collect events from various sources (logs, Kafka, REST APIs, etc.).
- **Detection Engine:** Apply detection logic to identify suspicious or malicious activity.
- **Alerting:** Generate actionable alerts based on ATT&CK techniques.
- **Reporting:** Produce summaries and visualizations of adversary activity.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new event sources, detection rules, or output integrations.

## Architecture
```
[Event Sources] --> [Ingestion] --> [ATT&CK Mapping] --> [Detection Engine] --> [Alerting/Reporting]
```

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.18 or higher
- (Optional) Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, or other integrations as needed
- Access to the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base (public or local copy)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. **Build the application:**
   ```sh
   go build -o attack-app
   ```

## Usage
### Run the Application
```sh
go run main.go
```
Or, if built:
```sh
./attack-app
```

### Example Configuration
Configuration is typically provided via a config file or environment variables. Example:
```yaml
kafka:
  brokers:
    - localhost:9092
  topic: security-events
attack:
  knowledge_base: ./attack.json
  alert_threshold: 3
```

### Command-Line Options
```sh
./attack-app --config config.yaml
```

## Configuration
- **Event Sources:** Configure where to ingest events from (e.g., Kafka, files, APIs).
- **ATT&CK Knowledge Base:** Path or URL to the ATT&CK JSON data.
- **Detection Rules:** Define thresholds or custom logic for alerting.
- **Output:** Configure alerting channels (console, email, SIEM, etc.).
